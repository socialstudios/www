                    <h1>About Social Studios</h1>
                    <p>Social Studios was founded by TV and Internet executives who saw an opportunity
                    to produce engaging, personalized TV shows from social media newsfeeds.
                    While social media platforms have yet to deliver a TV experience that viewers want to
                    watch, Social Studios’ social media TV app quickly identifies posts from people's close friends and favorite pages and automagically turns them into Your Show.
                    The professionally produced daily TV show, Your Show, complete with presenter, makes for entertaining viewing on any screen.

Before founding Social Studios, she led product development at Yahoo!, Gogobot, myThings, and FareChase. Her professional passion is providing outstanding user experience and value. On the home front, she shares the joys and challenges of raising four young children with her husband. She also enjoys singing with a local group to maintain a sense of balance.

Tapping into his web application development skills using open-source platforms, he’s built multiple apps and products based on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter that to date have been used by more than 100,000 consumers of online media. Moshi can take pretty much any idea and turn it into something real. During development or brainstorming for new concepts, or simply just to relax, he loves listening to music and playing on his acoustic guitar.

Considered a leader in the world of Israeli TV content and development, Yaeli also created three original reality shows, "TLV,"
                                    "U-Man," and "love lab,” all of which were sold to multiple countries around the world. On the rare occasion that she’s not working in TV, she follows politics with a passion and considers herself to be somewhat of a news junkie.</p>

She’s also appeared in numerous TV programs and films in the United States, among them “CSI,” “Ghost of Girlfriends Past,” and “Star Trek: Enterprise.” On the production side, she sold the first Israeli TV show to become an American series, “In Treatment,” to HBO. She co-produced the series, which won a Peabody Award and has been nominated for multiple Emmys and Golden Globes, with Mark Wahlberg. In 2012 Noa made the Hollywood Reporter list of 12 female executives to watch. She was also named one the 50 most powerful Jews in the world, alongside Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

                                    When not working on making your social experience a much better one, you'll probably find Itai spending time on one of his other main interests including Mobile Affiliate Marketing, reading (history)books and running along the Tel-Aviv coastline</p>
