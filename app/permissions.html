    <h3>Why do we ask for these permissions?</h3>
    <p>
        Users who do not grant us the required permissions will be redirected to a page explaining why we request these permissions.
        Here's the content for this page:

    <h3>Why is Your Show asking me for these permissions?</h3>
    <p class="whiteHD">
        Your Show produces a TV show from your Facebook news feed. Without accessing your information, we cannot produce Your Show for you.
    </p>
    <ul class="padding0">
        <li>
            <span class="bold f16">Access my basic information -</span>
            <p class="whiteHD">
                This the default permission that all Facebook apps require. It gives us basic info like your name and profile picture.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold f16">Send me emails -</span>
            <p class="whiteHD">
                We ask for you email address so we can share important information such as new features and your friends' activity on Your Show. We will not give email addresses to third parties.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold f16">Access my profile information -</span>
            <p class="whiteHD">
                We use this data, like the pages you like and the people you are friends with, in order to fully personalize Your Show . We store this data securely and only display it to people you let see it (based on your selected privacy settings).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold f16">Access my photos -</span>
            <p class="whiteHD">
                Here too we use your photos to personalize You Show, and at the same time respect your selected privacy settings so that you can choose whether people can see your photos.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold f16">Manage my events -</span>
            <p class="whiteHD">
                This permission allows us to remind you of upcoming events (like your friends' birthdays) on Your Show.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold f16">Access my family & relationships -</span>
            <p class="whiteHD">
                We believe people closer to you should get more screen time than acquaintances. This is why we're asking to access these lists.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="bold f16">Access information people share with me -</span>
            <p class="whiteHD">
                Your Show automatically sorts through the information shared by others on your news feed, and makes it into a personalized TV show. So we take the best of what people shared with you, to provide you with an entertaining experience. We hope you like it!
